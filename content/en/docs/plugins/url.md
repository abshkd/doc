This agent plugin periodically fetches specified HTTP or HTTPS URL (or POSTs to it), and records the response. The URL
is retrieved from the agent process, so any host and port reachable from the machine on which the agent
is running can be monitored.

@class=bg-warning docInfoPanel: An *agent monitor plugin* is a component of the Scalyr Agent. To use a plugin,
simply add it to the ``monitors`` section of the Scalyr Agent configuration file (``/etc/scalyr/agent.json``).
For more information, see [Agent Plugins](/help/scalyr-agent#plugins).


## Sample Configuration

Here is a simple configuration fragment showing use of the url_monitor plugin. This sample will record
the instance type of the Amazon EC2 server on which the agent is running.

    monitors: [
      {
        module:  "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.url_monitor",
        id:      "instance-type",
        url:     "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type"
      }
    ]


Here is a configuration fragment showing how to have the plugin issue a ``POST`` request while setting some of the HTTP Headers and setting custom request data:

    monitors: [
      {
        module: "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.url_monitor",
        id: "post-example",
        url: "http://your-url-to-make-post-request",
        request_method: "POST",
        request_headers: [{"header": "Accept-Encoding", "value": "gzip"}],
        request_data: "your-request-data"
      }
    ]

To monitor more than one URL, use several copies of the url_monitor plugin in your configuration.


## Viewing Data

After adding this plugin to the agent configuration file, wait one minute for data to begin recording. Then go to
the Search page and search for [$monitor = 'url_monitor'](/events?filter=$monitor%20%3D%20%27url_monitor%27).
This will show all data collected by this plugin, across all servers. You can use the {{menuRef:Refine search by}}
dropdown to narrow your search to specific servers and monitors.

The [View Logs](/help/view) page describes the tools you can use to view and analyze log data.
[Query Language](/help/query-language) lists the operators you can use to select specific metrics and values.
You can also use this data in [Dashboards](/help/dashboards) and [Alerts](/help/alerts).


## Configuration Reference

Option                   | Usage
``module``               | Always ``scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.url_monitor``
``id``                   | Included in each log message generated by this monitor, as a field named ``instance``. \
                                  Allows you to distinguish between values recorded by different monitors.
``url``                  | The URL to fetch. Must be an http or https URL.
``request_method``       | Optional (defaults to GET): The HTTP request method to make the request
``request_headers``      | Optional: The HTTP Headers to set when making the request. It is a list of dictionaries with  \
                                  keys ``header`` (header name) and ``value`` (header value)
``request_data``         | Optional: The HTTP request data to pass with the request. Only used with ``request_method`` POST.
``timeout``              | Optional (defaults to 10): the maximum amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the URL to load.
``extract``              | Optional: a regular expression to apply to the command output. If defined, this \
                                  expression must contain a matching group (i.e. a subexpression enclosed in parentheses). \
                                  The monitor will record only the content of that matching group. This allows you to discard \
                                  unnecessary portions of the command output and extract the information you need.
``log_all_lines``        | Optional (defaults to false). If true, the monitor will record the entire command output; \
                                  otherwise, it only records the first line.
``max_characters``       | Optional (defaults to 200). At most this many characters of output are recorded. \
                                  You may specify a value up to 10000, but the Scalyr server currently truncates all \
                                  fields to 3500 characters.


## Log Reference

Each event recorded by this plugin will have the following fields:

Field                    | Meaning
``monitor``              | Always ``url_monitor``
``metric``               | Always ``response``
``instance``             | The ``id`` value from the monitor configuration, e.g. ``instance-type``
``url``                  | The URL that was retrieved, e.g. ``http:/^^^/169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type``
``status``               | The HTTP response code, e.g. 200 or 404
``length``               | The length of the HTTP response
``value``                | The body of the HTTP response
