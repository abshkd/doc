{{% note %}}
__Note__: Spot instance feeds are made available in batches, so there can be a delay before
they show up in Scalyr. Amazon's documentation specifies a maximum delay of 24 hours, but this is
unusual in practice.

## Before You Start

1. Enable the spot instance data feed for your AWS account. See
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-data-feeds.html. It's best to create a new
S3 bucket just for this feed.

2. Create an SQS queue, and configure your S3 bucket to publish new-object notifications to the queue.

3. Use Amazon's IAM (Identity and Access Management) tools to create an IAM role account which can only be
used to read this bucket and queue. For instructions, see the section [Create IAM Role](#createIAMRole).


## Steps

Scalyr uses "monitors" to fetch data from other services. These steps will guide you
through creating a monitor to fetch your spot instance data feed.

1. From the navigation bar, click {{menuRef:Dashboards}}, and select {{menuRef:Monitors}}.

2. Click {{menuRef:Edit Monitors}} to open the monitors configuration file.

3. Find the ``monitors`` section of the configuration file. If you have never edited this file before,
the monitors section will look like this:

      monitors: [
        // {
        //   type:        \"http\",
        //   url:         \"http://www.example.com/foo?bar=1\"
        // },
        // {
        //   type:        \"http\",
        //   url:         \"http://www.example.com/foo?bar=1\"
        // }
      ]

4. Add a stanza for the SQS queue you created earlier. The section might now look like this:

      monitors: [
        {
          type: "s3Bucket",
          region: "us-east-1",
          accessKey: "XXX",
          secretKey: "YYY",
          queueUrl: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nnnnnnnnnnnn/scalyr-spot-instance-data"
          fileFormat: "spot_instance_data",
          hostname: "spot_instance_data"
        }
      ]

Fill in the appropriate values for each field:

Field                       | Value
type                        | Always ``s3Bucket``.
region                      | The AWS region in which your SQS queue is located, e.g. ``us-east-1``.
s3Region                    | The AWS region in which your S3 bucket instance is located, e.g. ``us-east-1``. \
                                     You can omit this unless it is different than ``region``.
accessKey                   | The Access Key ID you obtained when creating your IAM role.
secretKey                   | The Secret Access Key you obtained when creating your IAM role.
queueUrl                    | The name of the SQS queue to which your bucket sends new-object notices.
fileFormat                  | Always ``spot_instance_data``.
objectKeyFilter             | Optional. If you specify a value, then S3 objects are ignored unless their name \
                                     (object key) contains this substring. If you have multiple logs being published \
                                     to the same S3 bucket, use this option to select the appropriate subset.
hostname                    | The server name under which your spot instance data will appear in the Overview page. \
                                     Defaults to "S3Bucket".
logfile                     | The file name under which your spot instance data will appear in the Overview page. \
                                     Defaults to "S3Bucket".
logAttributes               | Specifies extra fields to attach to the messages imported from this log. Optional.

If you don't have the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for your IAM role account, you can generate a new key. From
the AWS console, go to the IAM service and select the IAM account you're using for spot instance data import. Choose the
"Security Credentials" tab, click Manage Access Keys, and then click Create Access Key. This will allow you to generate
a new Access Key ID / Secret Access Key pair.

Don't use credentials from your primary AWS account; always use an IAM role account with limited permissions. If
you haven't already done so, follow the [Create IAM Role](#createIAMRole) instructions to create a special role
account which only has access to the S3 bucket and SQS queue.

5. Click {{menuRef:Update File}} to save your changes. Scalyr will begin checking for new data batches once per minute.

6. Wait for the initial batch of data to be retrieved. It may take an hour or more for Amazon to publish the
first batch.

7. In the top navigation bar, click Overview. In the list of servers, you should see an entry named according to the
``hostname`` you specified in the monitor configuration. To the right will be a link to your spot instance data.

## Troubleshooting

If no data appears, make sure you've waited at least a few hours since saving your changes to the Monitors
configuration (i.e. since clicking Update File). Also verify that you have spot instances running (otherwise there
will be no data in your spot instance feed). Then return to the Scalyr Overview page and refresh your browser.

If the data still doesn't appear, you may have a configuration error which is preventing the Scalyr monitor from retrieving
your feed. To check for error messages, in Scalyr's top navigation bar, click {{menuRef:Search}}. In the
{{menuRef:Expression}} box, type ``tag='S3BucketMonitor'`` and click the {{menuRef:Search}} button. Click {{menuRef:Latest}}
to jump to the most recent log messages, and click on an individual message to see details for that message. If the details
page includes an "errorMessage" field, then AWS returned an error when Scalyr attempted to retrieve your feed. Some common error
messages:

## Appendix: Create IAM Role

You can use Amazon IAM to create a role account which can only be used to read your spot instance data feed. This allows
you to grant Scalyr the ability to import the feed, without opening up any other access to your AWS resources. Create
the IAM role as follows:

N. Make a note of your AWS account ID (a 12-digit number). You can find it near the top of the AWS
   [My Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/manageYourAccount) page.
N. Log into the Amazon AWS console. From the Services menu, choose "IAM".
N. Go to the Users list.
N. Click "Create New Users".
N. Enter a user name, such as "spot-data-reader".
N. Click "Create".
N. Click "Show User Security Credentials", and make a note of the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
N. Click "Close". Ignore the "You haven't downloaded the User security credentials" warning, and click "close" again.
N. In the user list, click on the newly created user.
N. In the "Permissions" section, click on the "Inline Policies" section, and then click the link to create an inline policy.
N. Click the "Select" button to use the Policy Generator.
N. Select the following values: ##
   ``  ``Effect: Allow                                              ##
   ``  ``AWS Service: Amazon S3                                     ##
   ``  ``Actions: check GetObject                                   ##
   ``  ``Amazon Resource Name: ``arn:aws:s3:::***bucket-name***/*`` ##
  Replace ``bucket-name`` with the name of the S3 bucket you specified when setting up the spot instance data feed.
N. Click "Add Statement".
N. Update the form with the following values: ##
   ``  ``Effect: Allow                                              ##
   ``  ``AWS Service: Amazon SQS                                    ##
   ``  ``Actions: check GetQueueAttributes, DeleteMessage, and ReceiveMessage            ##
   ``  ``Amazon Resource Name: ``arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:***account-id***:***queue-name***`` ##
  Replace ``account-id`` with your 12-digit AWS account ID, without hyphens. Replace ``bucket-name`` with the name of
  the SQS queue you subscribed to the S3 bucket.
N. Click "Add Statement".
N. Click "Next Step".
N. Click "Apply Policy".
