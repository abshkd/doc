# Date/Time Reference

When searching or graphing, you can view data from any period of time. Use a large time range to view 
long-term trends, or a narrow range to focus on current status or investigate a specific incident.

By default, the last four hours are displayed. You can
[customize this default](/help/tips#defaultSearchTimeSpan).

The time range is specified by the From and To fields:

[[[{type: "image", name: "nuiTimeDropdown-plain.png"}]]]

You can specify dates and times in almost any format, including shortcuts such as "4 hours" to indicate
four hours ago. You can leave the To box blank to include events up to the present time. You can also
enter a To value beginning with a "+" to indicate a time span, e.g. "+1 day" is 1 day after the From
time. The following examples illustrate the full array of date options:
