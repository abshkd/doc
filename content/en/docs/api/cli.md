# Command Line

The Scalyr command-line tool allows you to access Scalyr APIs from -- you guessed it -- the command line.
You can quickly and easily retrieve log data, and fetch and update configuration files. Search Scalyr
logs directly from your terminal; download parsed log data in CSV or JSON format; or copy configuration
files to local disk.

You can use the tool from any environment that supports Python scripts.

The tool, documentation, and source code are hosted on Github: https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-tool.
