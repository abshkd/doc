We design Scalyr to work with the the latest web browsers. Specifically, we support the following:

- [Chrome 57+](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox 52+](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html)
- [Edge 16+](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/microsoft-edge)
- [Safari 10.1+](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/)
- [Opera 44](http://www.opera.com/computer/)

We recommend the latest stable build of Chrome.

By keeping our list of supported browsers limited, we can focus on delivering the best experience 
in Scalyr. Supporting a wide range of technical requirements takes time away from improving the 
features that make Scalyr better. 

If you are encountering issues with the web site, we recommend clearing cache, 
restarting your browser, and disabling any extensions.
